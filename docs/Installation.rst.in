Installation
============
The package relies on MNE-python_ which is quite heavy and can take a very long time to install.
I would suggest to install MNE-python_ first and then install this package.
To `install MNE-python`_ you have several choices that are very well documented on their website:

To install the package:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python3 -m pip install Sam54000_eeg_modules

.. _MNE-python: https://mne.tools/stable/index.html
.. _install MNE-python: https://mne.tools/stable/install/index.html
